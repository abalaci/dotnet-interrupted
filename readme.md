# .NET, Interrupted

This is a curated list of noteworthy .NET projects that have been either
archived or abandoned.
A .NET project hosted on GitHub is currently considered noteworthy if
it has at least 100 stars, but this may be subject to change.

The list was created in the hope that some of these projects might be revived one day:
