# .NET, Interrupted

This is a curated list of noteworthy .NET projects that have been either
archived or abandoned.
A .NET project hosted on GitHub is currently considered noteworthy if
it has at least 100 stars, but this may be subject to change.

This list was created in the hope that these projects might be revived one day:

- [#develop](https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop):
A free IDE for .NET programming languages.
- [MarkdownSharp](https://github.com/StackExchange/MarkdownSharp):
An open source C# implementation of a Markdown processor, used by Stack Overflow.
- [MonoDevelop](https://github.com/mono/monodevelop):
A cross platform IDE for .NET.
- [Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy):
A lightweight, low-ceremony framework for building HTTP-based services on .NET and Mono.
